# Heyo! My name is Rin/Ethan!
I am a freelancer, indie game dev, MLH participant and teacher for Grades K-8!

## About Me
I code and stuff, I like to test projects and create some fun games and interactive UI/UX for the Command Line! I also do a lot of stuff in Cyber-Security which requires a lot of command prompt. I learned coding in python and eventually switched to C/C# for some freelancing projects, and currently I am returning to python because of the practicality in the workspace. The syntax barrier is huge, but it isn't anything I can't overcome!

## Projects (Planning on Exploring Soon)
- Virus Isolatior (VM Python?)
- Windows to Linux (Using Linux Commands on Windows Command Line Python)
