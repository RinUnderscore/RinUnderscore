# Heyo! My name is Rin/Ethan!
I am a freelancer, indie game dev(ish), backend developer, MLH participant and teacher for Grades K-8!

## About Me
I code and stuff, I like to test projects and create some fun games and interactive UI/UX for the Command Line! I also do a lot of stuff in Cyber-Security which requires a lot of command prompt. I learned coding in python and eventually switched to C/C# for some freelancing projects, and currently I am returning to python because of the practicality in the workspace. The syntax barrier is huge, but it isn't anything I can't overcome! I'm also working with some databasing such as Firebase and local hosting servers. Cloud Computing is amazing!

## Projects (TBD)
I'm being lazy lol
