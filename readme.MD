# Heyo! My name is Rin/Ethan!
-- note: my fiverr is closed for now, busy with stuff... might reopen eventually --

I am a freelancer, indie game dev(ish), backend developer, MLH participant and teacher for Grades 3-8!

I am teaching game development in person. I am currently learning LUA and creating modifications for games and such!

Currently, I have: 
- Top 40 Finish in MEGA Hackathon 2022 (JS Build) (with Fully Dynamic)
- Top 75 Finish in (MLH) Frey Hackathon 2022 (C++ Build) (with Fully Dynamic and Ishita S)

Fully Dynamic has been innactive, and I'm currently joining hackathons individually. If any notable projects/places, I'll let you know here!
